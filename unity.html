     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p>Unity, may seem a little abstract compared to the other six principles. Unity means that all the parts of the design work together, and everything looks like it belongs together.(p.55)</p>
       <p> A layout is visually unified if its different parts have visual links or relationships to one another. A good design has some consistency in terms of the pattern of type columns, or rhythm of typography, or style of visuals, etc. Unity refers to oneness, that the result is one cohesive design or visual message.(p.55)</p>
       <p> Unity is the principle on designing layout to make sure that everything that is grouped together looks as if it belongs together. When creating a layout, you may have a different set of images or text that do not look like they are correlated together. But as the designer, if you are able to find a way to work all of the elements together and have it look presentable, then you have constructed unity and have made the layout presentable to an audience.</p>
